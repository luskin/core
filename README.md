#### Setup

After cloning the repository, follow the following few steps to be up and running locally.

1. In one terminal, run `pnpm docker`. Wait for docker to finish booting, and keep it live.
2. Once docker is up, in another terminal, run `pnpm db:migrate`. This will migrate your local Postgres database.
3. Begin developing in any of the applications you wish. The root [package.json](./package.json) will contain all the dev commands you need. For example, if you'd like to develop on the `api`, simply run `pnpm dev:api` in the root of the monorepo and you should be up-and-running.
